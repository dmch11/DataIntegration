DIABETES RISK ASSESSMENT PREDICTIVE MODEL
-
Overview

Pima Indians Diabetes dataset is used to create a prediction model for estimating a person's probability of developing diabetes based on numerous health-related factors.

To forecast the risk of diabetes, linear regression was used.
Significant contributions from specific features were found via feature importance analysis.
Apache Spark was used for model construction.
By identifying feature coefficients, linear regression model was able to shed light on how characteristics and the chance of developing diabetes are related.
